# sqlalchemy-challenge

I found this challenge to be tricky.

In the first part of the challenge, I managed to connect (via and engine) to the database and interogate the two tables in it. I was able to create the dataframes and graphs required for the precipitation and station analyses. (Although I did fins some of the instructions to be confusing.)

In the second part, I was able to create the required Climate App using Flask. I was able to reproduce in the app the analyses I had done in the first part of the challenge. But admittedly, I found the instructions for the final route (start/end) to be really confusing. But I managed to produce something that seemed about right.
